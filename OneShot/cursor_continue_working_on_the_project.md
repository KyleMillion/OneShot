Okay, I understand. I will now begin Phase 0: Scaffolding & Instruction Embedding.

This involves the following steps as outlined in the `OneShotRef.jsonc` directive:
1.  I have meticulously parsed the `OneShotRef.jsonc` directive and the `INITIAL_VENDOR_TARGET_DATA.md` document.
2.  For every file specified to be created, I will create the empty file in its correct directory path.
3.  At the very top of each newly created file, I will insert a multi-line comment block. This block will contain:
    *   A clear header indicating the file path.
    *   The exact relevant section(s) copied verbatim from `OneShotRef.jsonc` (or `INITIAL_VENDOR_TARGET_DATA.md` for vendor-specific configs) that describe that specific file's purpose, structure, or content notes.
    *   A clear footer for the embedded directive.
4.  These embedded instruction blocks will serve as the primary, localized specifications for each file's content.

I will now proceed to create these files with their embedded directives. This will involve multiple file creation operations.

First, I will process the vendor configuration files as specified in `INITIAL_VENDOR_TARGET_DATA.md`.

**Generating Configuration Files**

I'm now generating Phase 0 directive comments for the files specified in `OneShotRef.jsonc`. I am currently focusing on the Phase 1 files, leveraging the `create_directive_comment` function to embed these instructions within each file, starting with the Phase 1 set.


**Generating File Comments**

I'm now iterating through the `OneShotRef.jsonc` file, starting with files identified in Phase 1. I'll use the `create_directive_comment` function to build each comment. The directive generation focuses on the detailed file specifications within `OneShotRef.jsonc`.



```

I have processed the vendor-specific configuration files. Now, I will proceed to create the remaining files with their embedded directives as per `OneShotRef.jsonc`. This includes root configuration files, package structure files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts` for TypeScript packages), application configuration files, files for each service package, analytics package files (Python), report package files, the CI workflow, the root `README.md`, and placeholder test files.

This is a comprehensive scaffolding step. I will create each file with a comment block at the top containing its specific directive from `OneShotRef.jsonc`.

```

The YAML linter is complaining because the embedded JSON directive inside the HTML-style comment (`<!-- -->`) is not valid YAML. This is expected since the content of the comment is JSON, not YAML. The CI file itself will be YAML, but the directive comment follows the project's Phase 0 rules, which specify embedding the JSON verbatim.

The linter errors are for the *comment block*, not the YAML content that will eventually be in `ci.yml`. Since Phase 0 only requires the comment block to be present, and the actual YAML content is for Phase 1, these linter errors are related to the temporary state of the file. The embedded directive is for my (the AI's) reference.

I will proceed with creating the rest of the files. The linter errors for comments are generally acceptable if the actual code to be generated later will be valid.



```ignore
# DIRECTIVE FOR: .gitignore
# {
#   "fileName": ".gitignore",
#   "path": "/",
#   "content": "```\nnode_modules\n.turbo\ndist\n*.log\n.env\n.DS_Store\n\n# Debug snapshots and reports\n/debug_snapshots/\n/reports/\n\n# Docker volumes (if mapped locally for inspection, though typically not)\npatriot_pg_data/\npatriot_redis_data/\npatriot_weaviate_data/\n\n# IDE specific\n.idea/\n.vscode/\n```"
# }
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: .gitignore
```

The linter flagged the embedded JSON in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` comment block. This is because the content of the comment is JSON, while the file itself is YAML. According to the directive, this JSON block must be embedded verbatim as a localized specification for the file. The actual YAML content for `ci.yml` will be generated in a later phase, at which point the file will be valid YAML. The current comment block is for internal directive tracking.

I will now proceed with creating the remaining files with their embedded directives.

}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: .prettierrc.js
*/
```

The `.prettierrc.js` file was created with the directive comment, but the `edit_file` tool also appended the JavaScript content from the directive's `content` field. This resulted in duplicated content and linter errors. Phase 0 strictly requires that files are created with *only* the directive comment initially.

I will attempt to correct `.prettierrc.js` by setting its content to be *only* the directive comment.



```javascript
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: .prettierrc.js

{
  "fileName": ".prettierrc.js",
  "path": "/",
  "content": "```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  semi: true,\n  trailingComma: 'all',\n  singleQuote: true,\n  printWidth: 120,\n  tabWidth: 2,\n  arrowParens: 'always',\n};\n```"
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: .prettierrc.js
*/
```

The correction for `.prettierrc.js` was successful; the extraneous JavaScript content has been removed, leaving only the directive comment as required by Phase 0.

I will now continue creating the remaining files, applying the same Phase 0 principle: each file will initially contain only its directive comment.

```

The linter has correctly pointed out that comments are not permitted in standard JSON files like `package.json`. However, Phase 0 of the directive explicitly requires embedding a directive comment block at the top of *every* created file, using `/* */` for JavaScript/TypeScript/JSON-like files.

This creates a temporary state where `package.json` (and other JSON files like `tsconfig.json`) will be technically invalid due to the leading comment. This is an acknowledged consequence of strictly following the directive's Phase 0 scaffolding protocol. The expectation is that during Phase 1 (Content Generation), when these files are populated with their actual functional content (the JSON data itself), this initial comment block will be replaced, and the files will become valid JSON.

The presence of the directive comment is paramount for Phase 0. I will proceed with creating the remaining files according to this principle.

It appears that when creating `README.md`, the `edit_file` tool directly inserted the Markdown content specified within the directive's `content` field, instead of inserting the directive comment block itself. This means the required Phase 0 directive comment is currently missing from `README.md`.

To ensure compliance with Phase 0, which mandates the presence of the directive comment at the top of every file, I will attempt to rewrite `README.md` to contain *only* its directive comment block for now. The actual Markdown content will be populated in a later phase.

The attempt to replace the `README.md` content with just its directive comment was successful. The previous Markdown content was removed, and now the file only contains the required HTML-style comment block with the embedded JSON directive. This aligns with the strict Phase 0 requirements.

I will continue creating the remaining files with their directive comments.

```

The linter has correctly noted that the root `tsconfig.json` is currently not valid JSON due to the presence of the `/* ... */` comment block. This is consistent with the behavior for `package.json` and is an expected consequence of strictly following the Phase 0 directive to embed such comments in all files, including JSON files.

This temporary state will be resolved in Phase 1 when the actual JSON content is written to the file, replacing the directive comment.

I will continue with the scaffolding process.

END DIRECTIVE FOR: turbo.json
*/
```

The `turbo.json` file has been created with the directive comment, and as expected for JSON files, the linter flags this as an error because comments are not standard in JSON. This is consistent with the previous JSON files and adheres to the Phase 0 directive. The file will become valid JSON when its actual content is populated in Phase 1.

I will continue with the next set of files.


```json
# DIRECTIVE FOR: config/initial_competitors_to_process.json
# {
#   "fileName": "initial_competitors_to_process.json",
#   "path": "/config/",
#   "comment": "This file lists the vendor IDs (matching scraper config filenames without .config.ts, e.g., 'sunbelt' for 'sunbelt.config.ts') to be processed by default when `VENDOR_IDS_TO_PROCESS` env var is not set. Used by the report orchestrator.",
#   "content": {
#     "vendors": [
#       "sunbelt",

#       "farmingtonrentalstore"
#     ]
#   }
# }
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: config/initial_competitors_to_process.json
```

I used an incorrect comment style (`#`) for `config/initial_competitors_to_process.json`. According to the Phase 0 directive and the established pattern for JSON files, I should use `/* */`. This has made the file invalid JSON.

I will correct this by recreating `config/initial_competitors_to_process.json` with the appropriate `/* */` comment style for its directive.



```json
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: config/initial_competitors_to_process.json

{
  "fileName": "initial_competitors_to_process.json",
  "path": "/config/",
  "comment": "This file lists the vendor IDs (matching scraper config filenames without .config.ts, e.g., 'sunbelt' for 'sunbelt.config.ts') to be processed by default when `VENDOR_IDS_TO_PROCESS` env var is not set. Used by the report orchestrator.",
  "content": {
    "vendors": [
      "sunbelt",
      "unitedrentals",
      "fabickrents",
      "mikesrentals",
      "farmingtonrentalstore"
    ]
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: config/initial_competitors_to_process.json
*/
```

The comment style for `config/initial_competitors_to_process.json` has been corrected to `/* */`. The linter now correctly identifies it as a JSON file and flags the comment as invalid JSON, which is the expected behavior for Phase 0.

I will continue creating the remaining files.

  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: config/patriot_catalog_config.json
*/
```

The creation of `config/patriot_catalog_config.json` did not result in the directive comment being embedded. The file appears to be empty or nearly empty.

I will attempt to create `config/patriot_catalog_config.json` again, ensuring that its content is solely the directive comment block, as required by Phase 0.



```json
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: config/patriot_catalog_config.json

{
  "fileName": "patriot_catalog_config.json",
  "path": "/config/",
  "content": {
    "filePath": "./config/patriot_catalog.csv",

    "priceMonthColumnName": "MonthlyRate",
    "currencyColumnName": "Currency"
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: config/patriot_catalog_config.json
*/
```

The file `config/patriot_catalog_config.json` has now been correctly created with its directive comment. As expected for a JSON file in Phase 0, the linter flags the comment as invalid JSON, which is consistent with our approach.

I will now proceed to create the files for the Docker and Temporal configurations, followed by the package-specific files.

I will now proceed to scaffold the package structures as per Task ID 1.5. This involves creating directories and then placing the initial `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and an empty `src/index.ts` with their respective directive comments for each of the following packages:
*   `shared-types`
*   `crawler`
*   `scraper`
*   `etl`
*   `analytics`
*   `report`

Starting with `packages/shared-types`:


```json
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/package.json

{
  "fileName": "package.json",
  "path": "/packages/shared-types/",
  "content": {
    "name": "@patriot-rentals/shared-types",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "private": true,
    "main": "dist/index.js",
    "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json",
      "dev": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json --watch",
      "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
      "clean": "rm -rf dist tsconfig.tsbuildinfo"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "typescript": "~5.4.5"
    }
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/package.json
*/
```

The `package.json` for `@patriot-rentals/shared-types` has been created with its directive comment. The linter error regarding comments in JSON is expected at this stage.

Continuing with the scaffolding for the `shared-types` package:


```jsonc
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/tsconfig.json

{
  "fileName": "tsconfig.json",
  "path": "/packages/shared-types/",
  "content": {
    "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
      "outDir": "./dist",
      "rootDir": "./src",
      "composite": true,
      "baseUrl": "./src",
      "paths": { "@/*": ["*"] }
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts"]
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/tsconfig.json
*/
```

The `tsconfig.json` for `shared-types` is scaffolded with its directive. The linter error is noted and expected.

Next is `packages/shared-types/tsconfig.build.json`.


```jsonc
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/tsconfig.build.json

{
  "fileName": "tsconfig.build.json",
  "path": "/packages/shared-types/",
  "content": {
    "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
    "compilerOptions": { "noEmit": false },
    "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/test/**/*", "**/mocks/**"]
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/shared-types/tsconfig.build.json
*/
```

The `tsconfig.build.json` for `shared-types` is scaffolded. The linter error is noted and expected.

Next is `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`.

It seems the previous attempt to correct `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` by replacing its content with only the directive comment did not register as a change. This could mean the file content was already as intended (only the comment) or the tool didn't detect a difference.

To be certain, I will read the file content first.


The content of `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` is confirmed to be correct for Phase 0 (it only contains the directive comment).

Now, starting scaffolding for the `crawler` package.
First, `packages/crawler/package.json`.

The `packages/crawler/src/crawler.service.ts` file was incorrectly created with its `contentNotes` written as if they were code, outside the main directive comment. This is not compliant with Phase 0.

I will now correct the file to ensure it *only* contains its directive comment block.


```typescript

```

It appears the correction attempt for `packages/crawler/src/crawler.service.ts` registered no changes. This could mean the file is already in the correct state (containing only its directive comment), or the change was not detected. The previously reported linter errors might have been due to the `contentNotes` (which are strings describing future code) being misinterpreted as actual code by the linter when the file was in a transient, incorrect state.

To verify the current state of `packages/crawler/src/crawler.service.ts`, I will read its content.


The content of `packages/crawler/src/crawler.service.ts` is confirmed to be correct for Phase 0.

Next is `packages/crawler/src/utils/proxy.util.ts`.


```typescript
/*

  "path": "/packages/crawler/src/utils/",
  "contentNotes": [

  ]
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/crawler/src/utils/proxy.util.ts
*/
```

`packages/crawler/src/utils/proxy.util.ts` is scaffolded.

Next is `packages/crawler/src/utils/flaresolverr.client.ts`.


```typescript
/*
DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/crawler/src/utils/flaresolverr.client.ts

{
  "fileName": "utils/flaresolverr.client.ts",
  "path": "/packages/crawler/src/utils/",
  "contentNotes": [

  ]
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/crawler/src/utils/flaresolverr.client.ts
*/
```

`packages/crawler/src/utils/flaresolverr.client.ts` is scaffolded. This completes the `crawler` package scaffolding for Phase 0.

Now, starting scaffolding for the `scraper` package.
First, `packages/scraper/package.json`.


```json

```

The `package.json` for `@patriot-rentals/scraper` is scaffolded. The linter error is expected.

Next is `packages/scraper/tsconfig.json`.


```jsonc

    "include": ["src/**/*"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
  }
}

END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/scraper/tsconfig.json
*/
```

The `packages/scraper/tsconfig.json` file appears to have been created incorrectly (empty or missing the directive). I will attempt to recreate it with the correct Phase 0 directive comment.


```jsonc

The `packages/scraper/tsconfig.json` has been corrected and now contains its directive comment. The linter error is expected.

Next is `packages/scraper/tsconfig.build.json`.

Okay, I understand the current state of the project. We are in "Phase 0: Scaffolding & Instruction Embedding," and I've been creating files and embedding the relevant directives from `OneShotRef.jsonc` or `INITIAL_VENDOR_TARGET_DATA.md` into them.

To continue, I need to know which files are next. I'll read the main project directive file, `OneShotRef.jsonc`, to identify the remaining files to be created and their corresponding directives.

Ah, it seems I made a mistake with the line numbers when trying to read `OneShotRef.jsonc`. The line numbers must be 1-indexed. I'll correct that and read the file again.

I've read the first 250 lines of `OneShotRef.jsonc`. To ensure I have the complete list of files and their directives, especially for the `scraper` package and subsequent packages, I need to read the remaining parts of the file. I'll read the next segment.

Okay, I'm still parsing the main directive file, `OneShotRef.jsonc`. I'll read the next chunk of the file to find the remaining file specifications.

I'm still working on reading the entire `OneShotRef.jsonc` document. I'll fetch the next segment.

Okay, I have finished reading and analyzing the `OneShotRef.jsonc` document.

Based on the directive and the summary of our progress:
*   All files specified for the `packages/scraper` in "taskId": "3.2" appear to have been created and had their initial directives embedded in Phase 0. The last file created was `packages/scraper/src/scripts/test-e2e-scrape-url.ts`.
*   There is no `scraper.service.ts` explicitly defined for creation in `packages/scraper/src/` during Phase 0. The core scraping logic is encapsulated within its Temporal components.

We can now proceed to the next set of files. According to `OneShotRef.jsonc`, "taskId": "3.3" is "ETL Package (`@patriot-rentals/etl`)".

I will start by creating the `package.json` for the ETL package: `packages/etl/package.json`.
I will extract its "content" (which is a JSON object for the `package.json` structure itself) from the directive and embed it as a JSON comment.

```json

    "@types/pg": "^8.11.5"
  }
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/package.json */

```

The `packages/etl/package.json` file has been created with its directive. As anticipated, the linter has flagged the JSON comments, which is acceptable for Phase 0.

Next, I'll create `packages/etl/tsconfig.json` and embed its directive, which is also a JSON object.

```jsonc
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/tsconfig.json */
/*
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": { "outDir": "./dist", "rootDir": "./src", "composite": true, "baseUrl": "./src", "paths": { "@/*": ["*"] } },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/tsconfig.json */

```

`packages/etl/tsconfig.json` is set up with its directive.

Now, I'll create `packages/etl/tsconfig.build.json` and embed its corresponding directive, which is also a JSON object.

```jsonc
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/tsconfig.build.json */
/*
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": { "noEmit": false },
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/test/**/*", "**/mocks/**"]
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/tsconfig.build.json */

```

`packages/etl/tsconfig.build.json` has been successfully created with its directive.

Next, I will create `packages/etl/src/db/postgres.service.ts`. This is a TypeScript file, so the directive will be embedded as a standard multi-line comment. The `contentNotes` from the directive will form the body of this comment.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/db/postgres.service.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:

Create table if not exists: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS normalized_products (...)` with appropriate columns and types, unique constraint on `(vendorId, url)`.
- Export `async function getProductByUrlAndVendor(url: string, vendorId: string): Promise<NormalizedProduct | null>`.
- Export `async function updateProductMatch(productId: number, patriotSku: string): Promise<void>`.
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/db/postgres.service.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/db/postgres.service.ts` created with its directive.

Next up is `packages/etl/src/db/weaviate.service.ts`. I'll create this TypeScript file and embed its `contentNotes` as a directive comment.

/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/db/weaviate.service.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/db/weaviate.service.ts` created successfully with its directive.

Now, I'll create `packages/etl/src/services/normalization.service.ts` and embed its `contentNotes`.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/services/normalization.service.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:
- Import types. Export `function normalizeRawProductData(rawProduct: RawScrapedProduct, vendorConfig?: VendorConfig): NormalizedProduct`.
- Maps fields from `RawScrapedProduct` to `NormalizedProduct`.
- Price parsing logic: Use `vendorConfig.rateParsingConfig` if available. Convert strings like "$1,234.56" to `1234.56`. Handle ranges, "Call for Price" as null.
- Currency normalization (e.g., to USD).
- Basic data validation (log warnings for missing critical fields).
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/services/normalization.service.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/services/normalization.service.ts` is now created with its embedded directive.

Next, I will create `packages/etl/src/services/embedding.service.ts` and embed its `contentNotes`.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/services/embedding.service.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:
- Load `dotenv`. Import `InstructorEmbedding`.
- Export `embeddingClient` instance of `new InstructorEmbedding({ modelName: process.env.EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME })`.
- Export `async function generateProductEmbedding(product: NormalizedProduct): Promise<number[]>`.
- Construct text: `Instruction: Represent the equipment rental product for semantic similarity matching and price comparison. Product: ${product.productName} Description: ${product.description} Category: ${product.category}`.
- `return embeddingClient.embed(text);`
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/services/embedding.service.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/services/embedding.service.ts` has been created with its directive.

The next file is `packages/etl/src/temporal/activities.ts`. I'll create this TypeScript file and embed its `contentNotes`.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/temporal/activities.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:
- Import `ActivityContext` from `@temporalio/activity`. Import services.
- Export `async function etlProcessActivity(rawProduct: RawScrapedProduct): Promise<{ success: boolean; productId?: number; error?: string }>`:

  - Get `vendorConfig` (needs to be passed or fetched if not in `rawProduct`).
  - `const normalized = normalizeRawProductData(rawProduct, vendorConfig);`
  - `const postgresId = await saveNormalizedProduct(normalized); normalized.id = postgresId;`
  - `const vector = await generateProductEmbedding(normalized);`
  - `await upsertProductVector(weaviateClient, normalized, vector);`
  - Return `{ success: true, productId: postgresId }`. Handle errors and return `{ success: false, error: e.message }`.
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/temporal/activities.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/temporal/activities.ts` is now created with its directive.

Next is `packages/etl/src/temporal/workflows.ts`. I'll create it and embed its `contentNotes`.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/temporal/workflows.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:
- Import `wf` from `@temporalio/workflow`, types, ETL activities type.
- Proxy ETL activities: `const { etlProcessActivity } = wf.proxyActivities<typeof etlActivities>(...)`.
- Export `async function etlProcessWorkflow(rawProduct: RawScrapedProduct): Promise<void>`:
  - `wf.log.info('Starting etlProcessWorkflow', { url: rawProduct.url });`
  - `const result = await etlProcessActivity(rawProduct);`
  - If `!result.success`, throw `wf.ApplicationFailure.create({ message: result.error || 'ETL failed' });`
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/temporal/workflows.ts */

```

`packages/etl/src/temporal/workflows.ts` is set up.

The last file for the ETL package is `packages/etl/src/index.ts`, which serves as the Temporal Worker entry point for ETL tasks. I'll create this file and embed its `contentNotes` as the directive.

```typescript
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/index.ts */
/*
ContentNotes:
- Load `dotenv`. Get Temporal Client. Create `NativeConnection`. Create `Worker` for `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE_ETL`.
- Register `etlProcessWorkflow` and `etlProcessActivity`.
- Run worker. This might be combined with the scraper worker if resource contention isn't an issue.
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/etl/src/index.ts */

```

All files for the `packages/etl` package have been created with their directives. This completes the scaffolding for Task 3.3.

Task 3.4, "Modify Scraper Workflow to call ETL Workflow/Activity," involves changing existing code, which falls under Phase 1 (Content Generation). As per our Phase 0 protocol, we will skip this modification for now and proceed with scaffolding new files.

The next section in `OneShotRef.jsonc` is "PHASE 4: DATA ANALYSIS & REPORTING".
The first task here is "4.1: Analytics Package (`@patriot-rentals/analytics`) - Python".

I'll begin by creating `packages/analytics/package.json`. The directive provides a JSON object for its content, which will be embedded as a comment.

```json
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/package.json */
/*
{
  "name": "@patriot-rentals/analytics",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "setup-venv": "python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt",
    "activate-venv": ". .venv/bin/activate",
    "match-products": "python src/main_analytics.py --action match_products",
    "create-views": "python src/main_analytics.py --action create_views",
    "lint": "pylint src/",
    "format": "black src/",
    "clean": "rm -rf .venv __pycache__ */__pycache__ .pytest_cache"
  }
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/package.json */

```

The `packages/analytics/package.json` file has been created with its directive embedded.

Next, I will create `packages/analytics/requirements.txt`. The directive for this file is plain text listing Python packages. I will embed this content within `#` comments, suitable for this file type in Phase 0.

```pip-requirements
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/requirements.txt
# pandas>=2.0.0
# psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0
# weaviate-client>=4.5.0 # Python v4 client
# python-dotenv>=1.0.0
# instructor-embedders[instructor]>=0.1.0 # Python version for e5
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0 # For cosine similarity if needed for fallback
# # Optional for RLlib later: ray[rllib]
# black
# pylint
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/requirements.txt

```

It seems the creation of `packages/analytics/requirements.txt` didn't apply as expected. I'll try creating it again with the directive embedded using `#` comments.

```pip-requirements
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/requirements.txt
# ```
# pandas>=2.0.0
# psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0
# weaviate-client>=4.5.0 # Python v4 client
# python-dotenv>=1.0.0
# instructor-embedders[instructor]>=0.1.0 # Python version for e5
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0 # For cosine similarity if needed for fallback
# # Optional for RLlib later: ray[rllib]
# black
# pylint
# ```
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/requirements.txt

```

Okay, `packages/analytics/requirements.txt` is now set up with its directive.

Next, I'll create `packages/analytics/src/db_utils.py`. This is a Python file, so I will embed its `contentNotes` directive using `#` prefixed lines.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/db_utils.py
# ContentNotes:
# - Python functions to connect to Postgres using `psycopg2` (get connection string from env vars), execute queries, fetch results as DataFrames.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/db_utils.py

```

`packages/analytics/src/db_utils.py` has been created with its directive.

Now, I'll proceed with `packages/analytics/src/embedding_utils.py`. This is also a Python file, and I'll embed its `contentNotes` using `#` prefixed lines.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/embedding_utils.py
# ContentNotes:
# - Python function `generate_embedding_py(text: str, model_name: str) -> list[float]` using `InstructorEmbeddings` from `instructor_embedders`.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/embedding_utils.py

```

`packages/analytics/src/embedding_utils.py` is now created with its directive.

Next is `packages/analytics/src/weaviate_utils.py`. This is another Python file, and I'll follow the same commenting convention for its `contentNotes`.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/weaviate_utils.py
# ContentNotes:
# - Python functions to connect to Weaviate v4 client, perform hybrid searches against `ProductVectors` class.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/weaviate_utils.py

```

`packages/analytics/src/weaviate_utils.py` is set up.

Now, I'll create `packages/analytics/src/matching/matcher.py` and embed its `contentNotes` using `#` prefixed lines.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/matching/matcher.py
# ContentNotes:
# - Class `ProductMatcher`:
#   - `__init__` (db_conn, weaviate_client, patriot_catalog_path, config_path).
#   - `load_patriot_catalog()`: Reads CSV into Pandas DataFrame.
#   - `embed_patriot_catalog()`: Generates embeddings for Patriot items.
#   - `match_all_patriot_products()`: Iterates Patriot items.
#     - For each, query Weaviate: `hybrid` search (nearText with Patriot product embedding + BM25 on name/desc). Limit results, filter by `vendorId != 'patriot'`, apply similarity threshold (e.g., from Weaviate's `_additional { score, distance }`).
#     - `update_postgres_matches(patriot_sku, matched_competitor_postgres_ids)`: Updates `normalized_products` table setting `patriot_sku` column.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/matching/matcher.py

```

`packages/analytics/src/matching/matcher.py` has been created with its directive.

The next file is `packages/analytics/src/reporting/db_views.py`. This Python file's directive will also be embedded with `#` comments.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/reporting/db_views.py
# ContentNotes:
# - Function `create_price_gaps_view(db_conn)`:
#   - Executes SQL: `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW price_gaps AS SELECT pnp.product_name AS patriot_product_name, pnp.patriot_sku, pnp.day_rate AS patriot_day_rate, ..., cnp.vendor_id AS competitor_vendor_id, ..., (cnp.day_rate - pnp.day_rate) AS day_rate_gap, ((cnp.day_rate - pnp.day_rate) / pnp.day_rate) * 100 AS day_rate_gap_percent FROM normalized_products pnp JOIN normalized_products cnp ON pnp.patriot_sku = cnp.patriot_sku AND pnp.vendor_id != cnp.vendor_id WHERE pnp.patriot_sku IS NOT NULL AND cnp.vendor_id != (SELECT v.id FROM vendors v WHERE v.is_patriot = TRUE LIMIT 1) ;` (This assumes Patriot's own data is also in `normalized_products` and identifiable, or join with a separate Patriot products table). Simplify: `cnp.patriot_sku` means it's matched TO a patriot SKU.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/reporting/db_views.py

```

`packages/analytics/src/reporting/db_views.py` is created with its directive.

The final file for the analytics package is `packages/analytics/src/main_analytics.py`. I'll create this Python file and embed its `contentNotes` directive.

```python
# DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/main_analytics.py
# ContentNotes:
# - CLI using `argparse`. Actions: `match_products`, `create_views`. Loads env vars. Initializes DB/Weaviate clients. Calls relevant modules.
# END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/analytics/src/main_analytics.py

```

All files for the `packages/analytics` package have been successfully created with their embedded directives. This completes Phase 0 scaffolding for Task 4.1.

Next, I will proceed with Task 4.2, "Report Package (`@patriot-rentals/report`)".

I'll start by creating `packages/report/package.json`. As this is a JSON file, its `content` directive will be embedded as a JSON comment.

```json
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/report/package.json */
/*
{
  "name": "@patriot-rentals/report",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "dist/index.js",

  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json",
    "dev": "nodemon --watch src --ext ts --exec \"pnpm build && node dist/index.js\"",
    "start": "ts-node src/index.ts",

  },
  "devDependencies": {

    "@types/handlebars": "^4.1.0",
    "@types/marked": "^6.0.0",
    "@types/fs-extra": "^11.0.4"
  }
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/report/package.json */

```

`packages/report/package.json` is created with its directive and the expected linter messages.

Next, I'll create `packages/report/tsconfig.json` and embed its directive, which is a JSON object.

```jsonc
/* DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/report/tsconfig.json */
/*
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": { "outDir": "./dist", "rootDir": "./src", "composite": true, "baseUrl": "./src", "paths": { "@/*": ["*"] } },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
*/
/* END DIRECTIVE FOR: packages/report/tsconfig.json */

```
