# Basic Temporal server configuration template for local development.
# This file is intentionally minimal â€“ the auto-setup image will merge in
# sensible defaults. Our only goal is to reference the dynamic-config file
# that already lives in this same directory so that the server starts.

dynamicConfigClient:
  filepath: config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml

# All other settings fall back to Temporal's internal defaults for the
# auto-setup container. Feel free to extend if you need custom ports or
# advanced persistence settings.
